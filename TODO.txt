Configuration
=============
- print warning if not running Python 2.7

ADDP
====
- Send error responses (if necessary) for unsupported commands.
- Consider supporting commands to configure the iDigi server settings via ADDP.
   - Requires addition of persistent state.
- Support configuration commands?

EDP
===
- Support other push methods than HTTP PUT (like the Messaging Facility).
- Support passwords.
- Change to using a thread instead of a state machine with tick?

RCI
===
- Edit query_settings and query_state so developer.idigi.com lists useful information for Device Properties.
- Fully support the do_command target "zigbee"?
- Fix descriptors! do_command targets are not being discovered.
- remove file management, unless root folder is specified.

ZigBee
======

GUI
===
- XIG interface
- show power button as disabled when polling fails.  Also, return from grey on reconnect.
- setup for Windows needs to copy non-Python files to dist directory.  Should also create Zip.
- XIG doesn't restart when XBee COM settings change.
- idigi_data target doesn't work in console (XBee address '127.0.0.1' invalid).
- add a README.TXT
- logs:
  - scroll lock
  - clear
  - filter? (http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojox/grid/EnhancedGrid/plugins/Filter.html#dojox-grid-enhancedgrid-plugins-filter)
  - save to file (http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojox/grid/EnhancedGrid/plugins/Exporter.html#dojox-grid-enhancedgrid-plugins-exporter)

XIG
===
- local ip address isn't valid until after iDigi connection completes.
- turn all of the prints into logging (finish)
- store mac/eui-64/ip addresses as an int
- Create .pro file for XBee

Windows
=======
- working with Python 2.7

Mac
===
- works with Python 2.7
- create an executable

Linux
=====
-test

Release
=======
- In addition to source code, use py2exe (Win) and py2app (Mac) to generate standalone applications for people who don't want to install Python.
