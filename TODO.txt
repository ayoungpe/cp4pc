README
======
- Require Python 2.5 or later.
- List PySerial requirement.
- May also have GUI requirement

Configuration
=============
- Create a single global settings location (currently simulator_settings.py)
- Integrate settings with the xig_config.py file?
- Try to keep location of settings to a minimum (XBee, RCI, and ADDP - only three places?)
- Store settings in JSON file (including MAC address and device ID).

ADDP
====
- Send error responses (if necessary) for unsupported commands.
- Consider supporting commands to configure the iDigi server settings via ADDP.
   - Requires addition of persistent state.
- Support configuration commands?

EDP
===
- Support other push methods than HTTP PUT (like the Messaging Facility).
- Support passwords.
- Merge in changes from Spectrum (support for vendor IDs and such)
- Change to using a thread instead of a state machine with tick?

RCI
===
- Edit query_settings and query_state so developer.idigi.com lists useful information for Device Properties.
- Merge in Spectrum code that supports query descriptors
- Make improvements to local web server feature.
- Fully support the do_command target "zigbee"?
- Support iDigi commands to update XBee firmware? (Probably not)

ZigBee
======
- Get rid of zigbee.py in favor of just xbee.py?

GUI
===
- Evaluate wxPython and PyQt as options.  Which is better for this project?
- Connection tab with various settings
- logs tab
- extra tabs for other stuff

Mac
===
- How do people typically install Python on a Mac?
- test

Linux
=====
-test

Release
=======
- In addition to source code, use py2exe (Win) and py2app (Mac) to generate standalone applications for people who don't want to install Python.
