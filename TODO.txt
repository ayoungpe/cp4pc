README
======
- Require Python 2.5 or later.
- List PySerial requirement.

ADDP
====
- Use actual interface settings.
   - Maybe http://alastairs-place.net/projects/netifaces/
- Send error responses (if necessary) for unsupported commands.
- Consider supporting commands to configure the iDigi server settings via ADDP.
   - Requires addition of persistent state.

EDP
===
- Auto-generate Device ID.  What does iDigi Connector do?
- Support other methods than HTTP (like the Messaging Facility).
- Support passwords.

RCI
===
T- Edit query_settings and query_state so developer.idigi.com lists useful information for Device Properties.
- Make improvements to local web server feature.
- Support iDigi commands to update XBee firmware?

iDigi
=====
- Implement necessary pieces for "XBee Networks" feature of developer.idigi.com to work.
- Confirm whether we're using https or not.
   - Need to check certificates?

ZigBee
======
T- Make sure remote AT commands (including IR, IS) work.
M- Get rid of zigbee.py in favor of just xbee.py?
- Does a gateway always send 6 parameters (e.g., transmit status handler).  Need to fix that.

GUI
===
- Evaluate wxPython and PyQt as options.  Which is better for this project?

Mac
===
- How do people typically install Python on a Mac?

Release
=======
- In addition to source code, use py2exe (Win) and py2app (Mac) to generate standalone applications for people who don't want to install Python.
